# YuCorrectMaya

## Goal

The objective of this project is to develop resources for the automatic translation of the Maya Yucatec language.

This comes in three stages:

1. Development of a validation application for a comparable corpus : the latter will allow the LIPN researchers to import / validate / corrected comparable corpora existing in this language, which will feed our database.

2. Starting an already developed (but incomplete) optical character recognition (OCR) module: it will exploit photos (taken or imported) containing text

3. Adaptation of the Wixarika translator to Maya Yucatec: existing Wixarika / Spanish translator to whom we wish to add a Maya / Spanish version with the resources repatriated by OCR. (This stage of the project is optional)
